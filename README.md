## How to Play Aviator

Aviator is a simple game to play. The objective of the game is to cash
out your winnings before the plane flies away. The plane will take off
and begin to fly, and the multiplier will increase as the plane flies
higher. You can cash out at any time by clicking the "Cash Out"
button.

The key to winning at Aviator is to cash out at the right time. If you
cash out too early, you will not win very much. If you cash out too
late, the plane will fly away and you will lose your bet.

## How to Win at Aviator

There is no surefire way to win at Aviator. However, there are some tips
that can help you increase your chances of winning.

-   Start with a small bet. This will help you to minimize your losses
    if you do not win.
-   Cash out early. Do not wait until the multiplier gets too high. It
    is better to cash out with a small profit than to lose your entire
    bet.
-   Use the auto cash out feature. This feature allows you to set a
    multiplier at which you want to cash out. This can help you to avoid
    cashing out too early or too late.
-   Take advantage of bonuses. Many casinos offer bonuses that can be
    used to play Aviator. These bonuses can give you extra funds to play
    with, which can increase your chances of winning.

not all bonuses are created equal. Some bonuses have high wagering

Others have short expiry dates, which can make it difficult to use the

When choosing a casino bonus, it is important to read the terms and
conditions carefully. Make sure that you understand the wagering
requirements and the expiry date before you claim the bonus.
